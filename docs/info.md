## How it works

In Progress- This project will be a pair of oscillators tuned to operate at 20Mhz and 21Mhz approximately (They'll oscillate on every corner, just not necessarily at exactly the right frequency)

## How to test

Measure the output from the first two analog pins to see the output signals 

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for this module to function
